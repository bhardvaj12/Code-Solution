# Code-Solution
Just a code solution to check wheather a number is armstrong number or not

#A number is an Armstrong Number or narcissistic number if it is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits.

'''153 = (1.1.1)+(5.5.5)+(3.3.3)  
where:  
(1.1.1)=1  
(5.5.5)=125  
(3.3.3)=27  
So:  
1+125+27=153'''
